title: Excess Stress Disease
---

Frequent doses of short-term stress is a good and necessary thing for life.
<br/>
<br/>
However...
<br/>
Over-thinking is a form of stress.
<br />
Over-work is a form of stress.
<br />
Another way to look at over-work is that under-sleep/rest/recovery is stress.
<br />
Bad nutrition is stress.
<br />
Over feeding is stress.
<br />
Bad environment is stress.
<br />
Bad friends/family/work is stress.
<br />
Again, over-thinking is stress.
<br />
Not thinking enough will probably lead to stress.
<br />
<br/>
To reiterate, regular doses of short-term stress is normal and healthy. It's the overdose of stress that we must be wary of.
