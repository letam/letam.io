title: Hello World!
---

I'm a web developer who believes that art is in everything that we do.
<br/>
I'm passionate about education, health (nutrition, psychology, fitness, wellness), and everything to do with performance optimization.
<br/>
I believe that we are most happy when we are free to express ourselves authentically with those we love, including ourselves.
<br/>
Remember that the universe has your back.
<br/>
It gave you life, after all.
