title: Six Pack Diet
---

Keep your diet simple.
I hereby present to you the six-pack diet:
<br/>
<br/>
You're not to drink a six-pack (or any alcohol)
unless you have a six-pack.
<br/>
If you don't have a six-pack, then
you're to evade shots of sugar (sweets).
<br/>
Train your mind and body.
<br/>
Cut out junk.
<br/>
Why you be eating and drinking gunk,
especially when you got some work to do on
that trunk?
<br/>
<br/>
You were born with the powers of a god.
<br/>
<br/>
Why not chisel your body and mind and honour the potential and gift of your spirit? ...

The point of the six-pack isn't merely to have a six-pack.
<br/>
How superficial would that be?
<br/>
The point is to look great when you're naked.
<br/>
Half kidding.
<br/>
The greater point is that you'll become one who has mastered their activities and appetites to an impressive and powerful level.
<br/>

Evolutionarily, we’re at the top of the food chain.
<br/>
We’re masters of adaptation. We are change makers.
<br/>
As humans, we've perhaps conquered the world.
<br/>
But that means nothing if we haven't conquered the demons that dwell within our minds and hearts.
<br/>

Simple, right?
<br/>
Never said that it was going to be easy...
<br/>
<br/>
Great change is neither comfortable nor easy.
<br/>
Transformation takes time.
<br/>
It's uncomfortable and can be rather painful.
<br/>
Like delivering a baby.
<br/>
So what are you gonna do?
<br/>
Are you gonna abort your dreams just because you face a lot of pain and hardship?
<br/>
Fuck easy.
<br/>

**Note:** As with many things, this is a work in progress.
